# AI Gateway

This contains a PoC for the AI Gateway project in collaboration between Bloomberg and Tetrate.

* [API.md](./API.md) is the generated documentation for the AI Gateway Custom Resource Definition (CRD) which
is the interface for users to interact with the AI Gateway.
* [testdata](./test/e2e/testdata) directory contains example yaml files that give you a good idea of how the PoC works.
